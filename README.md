# Mapping Earthquakes with Leaflet and Mapbox

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create visualizations of earthquake data from the U.S. Geological Survey using Leaflet.js and Mapbox API. These earthquakes are visually represented by circles and colors, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. Popup markers and multiple map styles are also included in the map to improve the user experience.
 
 

## Software and APIs
- A code editor, such as VS Code
-JavaScript
- HTML
- D3.js
